# conan-recipes
Conan recipes created by me.


[Conan](https://conan.io/) is a Package Manager for C++. While many libraries are already provided in the official repositories, some of the libraries I need are not and thus I have created recipes for them.

Each folder in this repository is a different recipe.
You can create a package and install it in your local conan cache.

# Note

This repository was archived in favor of having one repository for each recipe. The repository names for the different recipes follow the convention `conan-<library_name>`.
